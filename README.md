# gym-uds-api
This project is inspired by [gym-http-api](https://github.com/openai/gym-http-api) and provides a local [Unix domain socket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket) API to the [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) toolkit, allowing development in languages other than Python.
